In that case, the larger phrase is explained first, and its parts afterward.</p><h3>Translation Notes Examples</h3><blockquote><p><strong>But it is to the extent of your hardness and unrepentant heart</strong> that you are storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath (Romans 2:5 TPL).</p></blockquote><ul><li><p><strong>But it is to the extent of your hardness and unrepentant heart</strong> - Paul uses a metaphor to compare a person who refuses to obey God to something hard, like a stone. He also uses the metonym “heart” to represent the whole person. Alternate Translation: “It is because you refuse to listen and repent” (See: <em>Metaphor</em> and <em>Metonymy</em>).</p></li><li><p><strong>hardness and unrepentant heart</strong> - The phrase “unrepentant heart” explains the word “hardness” (See: <em>Doublet</em>).</p></li></ul><p>In this example the first note explains the metaphor and the metonym in the longer phrase as a whole, and the second note explains the doublet within the longer phrase.</p>",
